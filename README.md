## üö® IMPORTANT SECURITY WARNING üö®

**This application is intended for personal and home use only.**

Due to the complexity of blocking all Windows system shortcuts, **it is possible to bypass the screensaver using certain key combinations** (e.g., `Alt+Tab`, `Win+D`). This could grant unauthorized access to your desktop.

**‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT use MotionSaver in public spaces, offices, or any environment where security is a concern.** The project is an ongoing effort, and full lock-screen security is not yet implemented. Use at your own risk.

## About the Project üí°

This project started as a dream inspired by Wallpaper Engine and the beautiful live wallpapers on macOS. For years, it was just an idea. But with the rise of AI development tools like GitHub Copilot, that dream became a reality in a single weekend. This application is a testament to the power of AI-assisted coding, turning what would have taken months into a 20-hour sprint.

I built it for my own personal use, and I'm sharing it in case others find it cool too. Enjoy!
