## Installation for Users (Recommended)

This is the easiest way to get started with MotionSaver using the provided batch file.

### Prerequisites
- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or Windows 11.
- **Git**: [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher. [Download & Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (ensure you check "Add Python to PATH").
- **Permissions**: Standard user permissions are sufficient for normal use. Administrator rights are needed to install it as a service.

### Method 1: From Source Code

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chinmay-sawant/MotionSaver.git
cd MotionSaver
```

#### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Step 3: Initial Configuration
```bash
# Run the settings GUI to configure the application
python PhotoEngine.py --mode gui
```

1.  In the settings window, go to the **"General Settings"** tab.
2.  Click **"Select Video"** to choose a video file for your screensaver background.
3.  Go to the **"Users"** tab to add a user and set a password for unlocking the screensaver.
4.  Explore the **"Widgets"** and **"Appearance"** tabs to customize your experience.
5.  Click **"Save & Close"**.

#### Step 4: Start Background Service
Use the provided batch file to start MotionSaver in the background:
```bash
# Double-click MotionSaver.bat or run from command line
MotionSaver.bat
```

This will start the application in tray mode, listening for the `Win + S` shortcut to activate the screensaver.

#### Step 5: Launch the Screensaver
You can start the screensaver in several ways:
- Press `Win + S` while the background service is running.
- From the system tray icon, right-click and select "Start Screensaver".
- Run from the command line: `python PhotoEngine.py --mode saver`.

## Installation for Developers

This method is for users who want to modify the source code or contribute to the project.

### Prerequisites
- **Git**: [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher. [Download & Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (ensure you check "Add Python to PATH").

### Method 2: Development Setup

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chinmay-sawant/MotionSaver.git
cd MotionSaver
```

#### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
# Create the virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On Windows Command Prompt
venv\Scripts\activate
# On PowerShell
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

#### Step 3: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Step 4: Run the Application

# Run the settings GUI
python PhotoEngine.py --mode gui

# Run the screensaver
python PhotoEngine.py --mode saver

# Run in background (tray mode)
python PhotoEngine.py --mode tray
```

## Advanced Setup

### Running as a Windows Service

This allows MotionSaver to run automatically in the background. **Administrator privileges are required.**

1.  **Run in Admin Mode**: Right-click your Command Prompt or PowerShell and select "Run as administrator". Navigate to the MotionSaver directory.
2.  **Launch Admin GUI**:
    ```bash
    python PhotoEngine.py --mode admin
    ```
3.  **Use the GUI**: In the settings window, a "Service Management" section will be visible.
    -   **Install Service**: Registers MotionSaver as a Windows service.
    -   **Start Service**: Starts the service.
    -   **Stop Service**: Stops the service.
    -   **Uninstall Service**: Removes the service from your system.

---

## Configuration

-   All settings are stored in a `userconfig.json` file located in a `config` sub-folder, which is created automatically in the same directory as the source code.
-   You can configure everything through the GUI (`python PhotoEngine.py --mode gui`).

---

## Troubleshooting

#### Screensaver Doesn't Start
-   Ensure you have selected a valid video file in the settings.
-   Check if your video format is supported (MP4 is recommended).
-   Ensure all dependencies in `requirements.txt` are installed correctly.
-   Make sure the background service is running (`MotionSaver.bat` or `python PhotoEngine.py --mode tray`).

#### Widgets Not Working
-   **Weather/Stock**: These widgets require an active internet connection. Check your firewall settings to ensure Python is not blocked.
-   **Media Widget**: This relies on Windows Media Session. It may not work on older versions of Windows or "N" editions without the Media Feature Pack installed.

#### Permission Errors
-   If you see permission errors when trying to install the service, make sure you are running the command or the GUI as an Administrator.

#### Background Service Not Working
-   Ensure Python is added to your system PATH.
-   Check if the batch file is being blocked by antivirus software.
-   Try running `python PhotoEngine.py --mode tray` directly from command line to see error messages.

## Uninstallation

#### Standard Uninstallation:
1.  **Stop the Service (if installed)**: Run `python PhotoEngine.py --mode admin` as an Administrator and click "Stop Service", then "Uninstall Service".
2.  **Stop the Background Service**: Close the MotionSaver.bat process or exit from the system tray.
3.  **Delete the Files**: Delete the entire `MotionSaver` directory.

#### If you used a Virtual Environment:
1.  **Uninstall the Service (if installed)**: Run `python PhotoEngine.py --mode admin` as an Administrator and use the GUI to stop and uninstall the service.
2.  **Deactivate Virtual Environment**:
    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```
3.  **Delete the Project Folder**: Simply delete the entire `MotionSaver` directory.
